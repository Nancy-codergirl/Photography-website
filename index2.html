        <h1>Hi! I am Nancy and i love taking photographs<h1/>
            <h2>I love photography and the camera is just a sketchbook,an instrument of intuition and spontaneity.My interest in photography is not to capture an image I see or even have in my mind but to explore the potential of moments I can only begin to imagine</h2>
