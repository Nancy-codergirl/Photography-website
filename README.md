# Photography-website.

The name of my website is Shots-kit.This is a photography website that contains photography shots that I have taken over time.Photography captures and stores moments gone forever.I love capturing moments and storing memories not only for myslef but others also.
Shots-kit basically means photography shots that have been summed up together collectively to fully captures moments.This project helps clients who would want to savour their moments through photography to be able to do so by booking a photography session.
